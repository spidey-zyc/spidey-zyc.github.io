I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at [the School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Over the past year, I have been interning at the [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.github.io/zh/).
In my spare time, I have a keen interest in football, running, and exploring new things—these activities not only help me stay physically active but also broaden my horizons and spark my curiosity for unknown areas. Looking ahead, I am eager to contribute my own efforts to the development of the AI industry, and I sincerely hope to have more exchanges and interactions with professionals and peers in this field to learn from each other and make common progress.
